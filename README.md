# RecipeWebApp

This is a work in progress.

The recipe web app (a web app version of the RecipeApp program I have an existing repository for) will allow users to build a custom database of recipes and then 
generate a list of recipes from their database that match any ingredients they have on-hand in their household with the purpose of reducing overall household food waste. 

Currently, this project consists of a back end that utilizes node and express, while the front end utilizes react.

When complete, this project will also implement a MongoDB database. In its current state, it simply reads and writes recipe data to a JSON file.
